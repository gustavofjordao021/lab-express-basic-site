                <p class="about-copy">Born in 2012 in Rio de Janeiro, Bruce is not your ordinary French Bulldog. With an immense personality, Bruce likes to think of himself more as a Lion 🦁 than a lap dog, and tries to impose all his 30 lbs on every dog he meets. So far, <em><b>none</b></em> of the dogs actually believed he is a lion.</p>
                <p class="about-copy">Passionate about retrieving tennis balls 🥎, Bruce also enjoys long walks on the backyard and around the neighborhood. He's also a declared fan of sleeping on the couch or on other people's beds instead of his own, and has successfully destroyed 5 couch pillows till this date.</p>

            <div class="about-div">
                <p class="about-copy">A well-traveled 🌎, cultured dog, Bruce understands English, Portuguese, and Spanish which to all he only respond when he feels like it. And there's very little one can do about it, really 🤷🏻‍♂️.</p>
                <p class="about-copy">Having visited several different cities, Bruce still prefers his own backyard where he roams free and observes his empire 👑. Although having access to a pool year-round, avoids water 💦 (and showers, mostly) like the devil runs from a cross.</p>
